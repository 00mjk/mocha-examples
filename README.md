# Mocha examples

A set of examples to help demontrate common configurations using Mocha. They should all run out-the-box.

## Examples

* [Async setup with --file](async-setup-with-file/)
* [Babel application](babel/)
* [Karma](karma/)
* [Programmatic usage](programmatic-usage/)
* [React, webpack](react-webpack)
* [Selenium application](selenium/)
* [Third party reporter](third-party-reporter/)
* [TypeScript application](typescript/)
* [Vue and Puppeteer application](vue-puppeteer/)
* [TypeScript, Babel](typescript-babel/)
* [Express REST API](express-rest-api/)

## Requirements

Each example application will have its own package dependencies but also a [version of Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) it was designed and built from.

## Reporting a bug?

Feel free to send a branch to supply an MCVE from one of the applications.

## Potential setups to add in future

- Angular
- async setups (i.e. `--delay`)
- Pipe json output to file

We welcome suggestions on other useful setups.
