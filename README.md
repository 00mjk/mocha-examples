# Mocha working examples
A set of working examples to help demontrate common configurations using Mocha.

## Requirements

Each example application will have its own package dependencies but also a [version of Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) it was designed and built from. Lower versions have not been tested so might not work, please be aware. Feel free to submit any fixes for lower versions.

## Reporting a bug?

Feel free to send a branch to supply an MCVE from one of the applications.

## Potential setups to add in future

- 3rd party reporter
- Browser (including Karma)
- Angular
- async setups (i.e. `--file` plus root hooks, `--delay`)
- Pipe json output to file
- Typescript and Babel combination

We welcome suggestions on other useful setups.
